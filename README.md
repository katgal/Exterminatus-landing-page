# Exterminatus-landing-page

A landing page sponsored by Adeptus Mechanicus!

As we know **Exterminatus** is an excellent way to purge heresy of every world, and as we live in 40k millenium it is about time to mark our presence on the Internet. And that is why this site was created. We searched for an eager and devoted to front-end development human. We found an open-minded female and this site was evolving along with hers decreasing level of heresy. Hovewer before her long route to master various front-end skills she need to remember that "For those who seek perfection there can be no rest on this side of the grave".

I am aware that this site may not be the "purest" of the Internet, but I am at the beginning of my webdev route.

**Exterminatus** is build with HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, jQuery and Emperors love.

Website is also fully responsive.

Here is live version of [Exterminatus](https://katgal.github.io/Exterminatus-landing-page/).

*Please note: If you are using horizontal DevTools plaese read annotation in header.

**"Exterminatus" was created in free-heresy-mode, but as we know "There is no such thing as innocence, only degrees of guilt"...
